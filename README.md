# The Liyukou Dataset for HSI-RGB Multimodal CD
The dataset covers an area of Liyukou, Huyi, Xi’an, Shannxi Province, which contains a RGB image captured on November 18, 2022 and an HSI taken on April 06, 2023, as shown in Figs. (a) and (b), respectively. The RGB image was obtained by FILR DUO Rro R sensor and the HSI was captured by Micro-Hyperspec sensor. The dataset encompasses diverse scenes,including trees, roads, soil, and buildings, showcasing the dynamic changes of various ground objects such as farmlands and land covers. The ground-truth map is depicted in Fig. (c).
